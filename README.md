# CityListDemo
This is a demo app for demonstrating how to create a App which is showing informations form 2 different endpoints within a table view list and can be navigate to a detail page.

I have import Promise into the APP for async data/image fetching. The endpoint data and images are cached by CoreData. And the APP also should be able to support the drag to refresh.

There might be some small/minor issues with the App, let me know if you found some issues that's better to be fixed.
